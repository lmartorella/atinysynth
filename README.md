ADSR-based Polyphonic Synthesizer
=================================

This project is intended to be a polyphonic synthesizer for use in
embedded microcontrollers.  It features multi-voice synthesis for multiple
channels.

The synthesis is inspired from the highly regarded MOS Technologies 6581
"SID" chip, which supported up to 3 voices each producing either a
square wave, triangle wave or sawtooth wave output and hardware
attack/decay/sustain/release envelope generation.

This tries to achieve the same thing in software.

Code is presently a work-in-progress.
